This project leverages a multi-regression machine learning model built using linear regression techniques. The core functionality revolves around predicting prices based on user-input features. 
I have implemented a user-friendly interface using a Flask server, complemented by HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements.

**Key Features:**

**Machine Learning Model:**
-Utilized a multi-regression approach with linear regression algorithms. Trained the model to predict prices based on input features. 
-Model has an R-squared Score: 0.8078398064430103

**Web Application:**
-Implemented a Flask server to handle user requests.
-Designed a clean and intuitive user interface with HTML.
-Styled the application for an enhanced user experience using CSS.
-Incorporated JavaScript to facilitate dynamic interactions.

**User Interaction:**
-Users can input relevant features.
-The application processes the input using the machine learning model.
-The predicted price is then displayed on the screen.

**Technologies Used:**
-Machine Learning: Linear Regression
-Web Framework: Flask
-Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
